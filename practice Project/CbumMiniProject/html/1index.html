                    <h3>About:</h3>
                    <p>Christopher Adam Bumstead (born 2 February 1995) is a Canadian IFBB professional bodybuilder.
                        Bumstead is the reigning Mr. Olympia Classic Physique winner, having won the competition in
                        2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022. He was also the runner-up in 2017 and 2018. He is often referred to
                        by his nickname Cbum.
                    </p>
                    <P>Growing up, bodybuilding was only a hobby for Bumstead. Chris played many sports, ranging from
                        soccer to baseball, basketball, and ice hockey. This developed Bumstead's love for the gym, as
                        he got into weightlifting his freshman year of high school. When Chris met his sister's
                        boyfriend, Iain Valliere, he quickly saw the potential Chris held and helped him capitalize on
                        it. Iain helped develop Chris and got him ready to compete by 2014.</P>

                    <h3>Career:</h3>
                    <p class="paraMain">Bumstead made his competitive debut at age 19 in 2014 and obtained his IFBB pro card at age 21
                        after claiming the 2016 IFBB North American Bodybuilding Championship. Chris impressed the
                        crowd and judges in his first Mr Olympia back in 2017, taking second place in the Classic
                        Physique category. The results were the same for Bumstead in the 2018 Olympia
                        competition, except his conditioning was worse compared to the previous year. Chris was
                        hospitalized 4 weeks out from the 2018 competition due to severe water retention in his body. He
                        spent three nights in the emergency room, and was given a strong diuretic to flush out potassium
                        due to a kidney issue. Eventually, Chris was released and could continue to train, but this was
                        a huge setback.

                        Bumstead rose to international fame as he reached the top of the podium in 2019, 2020, 2021 and
                        2022, making him the current reigning champion in Men's Classic Physique.</p>
