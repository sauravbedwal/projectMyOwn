                Bölöni, who was impressed with his dribbling.[25] He subsequently became the first player to play for
                the club's under-16, under-17 and under-18 teams, the B team and the first team, all within a single
                season.[17] A year later, on 29 September 2002, Ronaldo made his debut in the Primeira Liga, against
                Braga and on 7 October, he scored two goals against Moreirense in their 3–0 win.[26] Over the course of
                the 2002–03 season, his representatives suggested the player to Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier and
                Barcelona president Joan Laporta.[27] Manager Arsène Wenger, who was interested in signing Ronaldo, met
                with him at Arsenal's stadium in November to discuss a possible transfer.[28]
